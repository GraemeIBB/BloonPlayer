# Bloom Player

current highest round: 104 - Meadows, easy
notes: mostly wizards

## About

The goal of this project is to facilitate the playing of BTD6 without any human input. This means no scripts, no recorded actions to replicate. I want this to be as dynamic as possible, and indistinguishable from a high level player.
